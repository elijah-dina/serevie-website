    <h2>Overview of Fertility Treatments</h2>
    <p>Each couple’s fertility journey is unique. At Serevie, we guide you through available medical, lifestyle, and assisted reproductive options, ensuring clarity, comfort, and compassionate care.</p>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Timed Intercourse</h3>
      <p>This natural and non-invasive approach aligns sexual intercourse with ovulation to maximize chances of conception. It is often a first step before advanced treatments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)</h3>
      <p>IUI involves placing specially prepared sperm directly into the uterus around ovulation time, increasing the likelihood of fertilization. It’s a simple and commonly used fertility procedure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF / ICSI)</h3>
      <p>IVF helps couples conceive by fertilizing eggs with sperm in a lab and transferring the resulting embryos into the uterus. It’s a proven treatment for many infertility causes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Egg Freezing</h3>
      <p>Women may choose to freeze eggs in their 20s or 30s to preserve fertility for future family planning or before medical treatments that could affect fertility, such as chemotherapy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Sperm Freezing</h3>
      <p>Men can store sperm for future use, often before undergoing medical treatments or for family planning flexibility. Stored samples remain viable for years.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Embryo Freezing</h3>
      <p>Extra embryos from an IVF cycle can be safely frozen for later use, offering additional opportunities without repeating stimulation or egg retrieval procedures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET)</h3>
      <p>In FET, previously frozen embryos are thawed and transferred into a prepared uterus. This process is as effective as fresh transfers and less physically demanding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Genetic Testing</h3>
      <p>Advanced testing can identify genetic conditions in embryos, helping reduce the risk of inherited disorders and improving implantation success rates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Gender Selection</h3>
      <p>In certain cases and under medical or ethical guidance, gender selection may be available through preimplantation genetic testing as part of IVF procedures.</p>
