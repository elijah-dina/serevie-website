    <h2>Understanding Fertility</h2>
    <p>Fertility is the ability to achieve pregnancy, and it evolves with age and health factors. For women, both egg quality and quantity decrease naturally with time, influencing the chances of conception.</p>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Female Fertility and Age</h3>
      <p>As a woman ages, the quality and number of eggs in her ovaries decline. This natural process can impact fertility, but understanding it helps in planning family goals effectively.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Low AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone)</h3>
      <p>AMH is a hormone released by follicles in the ovaries and helps estimate the remaining egg supply. A lower AMH level may indicate fewer available eggs, though it does not reflect their quality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)</h3>
      <p>PCOS affects how a woman’s ovaries function and may cause irregular cycles, hormonal imbalance, and fertility issues. It affects around one in ten women and may run in families.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Endometriosis</h3>
      <p>This condition occurs when tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, often causing pain and fertility challenges. It affects about 1 in 10 women of reproductive age.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Tubal Factor Infertility (TFI)</h3>
      <p>TFI occurs when the fallopian tubes are blocked or damaged, preventing the egg from meeting the sperm. Conditions like infection, scarring, or congenital abnormalities can contribute.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Recurrent Miscarriage</h3>
      <p>Defined as two or more consecutive losses before 20 weeks of pregnancy, recurrent miscarriage can have various causes. Early medical evaluation and emotional support are essential.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Unexplained Infertility</h3>
      <p>In some cases, no specific cause for infertility is found despite normal results. Treatment often involves lifestyle improvements, fertility medication, or assisted reproduction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Recurrent IVF Failure</h3>
      <p>Multiple unsuccessful IVF cycles may result from several factors including egg or sperm quality, uterine environment, or timing. Guidance and lifestyle optimization can improve outcomes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Male Fertility</h3>
      <p>Men produce millions of sperm from puberty onward. Factors such as obesity, smoking, alcohol, steroids, and hormonal imbalance can affect sperm quality, quantity, and motility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Understanding Infertility</h3>
      <p><strong>Primary infertility</strong> refers to difficulty conceiving after 12 months of trying (or 6 months if over age 35). <strong>Secondary infertility</strong> occurs when a couple struggles to conceive after a previous successful pregnancy.</p>
